Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off — then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this.

Download the file \"[ls_orchid.fasta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biopython/biopython/master/Doc/examples/ls_orchid.fasta)\" to your computer (should also be on Canvas and on the servers), upload it to your home directory, and use your function to count the number of sequences in the file (by determining the number of greater-than symbols.
