##Hello to whoever is grading this!
Hi, Jacks here. This might not be as eloquent or as beautiful as one might like, but it'll get the job done.


In this blog post, I'm going to go over a basic but powerful concept in Python we learned in class. I will also use reticulate to demonstrate how you can move around information from R to Python and vice versa, as per the rubric.


###Python Example

Let's talk about regular expression or regex. According to Google, the definition of regular expression is "a sequence of characters that define a search pattern." In other words, regex is a more powerful control + F, with more freedom and flexibility in the characters you can look for.


For this example, I'm going to reference Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob SquarePants - more specifically, his laugh. Refer to this short clip if you have no idea what I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhM4VQFkw04


From a Reddit post, I found that the onomatopoeia of Mr. Krabs's laugh is "argh argh argha rghargh" - thus, that is the string we will be using for this example.


Regex is a module that must first be imported into Python. From there, you can use different functions and special characters to find exactly what you're looking for.


To find every instance of `a` followed by any single character (including white spaces), we would run the following code:


```{python}
import re
mrkrabslaugh="argh argh argha rghargh"
re.findall(r"a.",mrkrabslaugh)
```


To find every instance of `a` followed by any 2 alphanumeric characters, we would run the following code:


```{python}
re.findall(r"a\w\w",mrkrabslaugh)
```


Finally, to find every instance of `argh`, followed by a space, we would run the following code:


```{python}
re.findall(r"argh\s",mrkrabslaugh)
```


In short, regex gives us the power to search for sequences of characters in any given string. As shown by the examples above, there is a lot of flexibility in what you can search for. However, I'm not here to give you a thorough rundown or complete understanding of how to use regex - cheatsheets exist online for that reason.


###Reticulate Example

Now, onto the reticulate example. Reticulate allows the user to use both R and Python to move around and manipulate information. I'm going to demonstrate a very simple example, where I pull some previously existing data from R to get a desired output in Python.

First, the reticulate library has to be imported into R. I created a random vector of numbers, ranging from 376 to 461 in R and labeled it `MJ` for this example.

```{R}
MJ <- c(433, 394, 461, 458, 393, 445, 376, 412, 390, 438)
```


We then take the vector `MJ` and save it as a vector in Python. From there, we can find the mean of the original vector, `MJ`, now labeled `emjay` in Python.


```{python}
import numpy as np
emjay = r.MJ
np.mean(emjay)
```


This tells us that the original vector `MJ` has a mean of 420. What a complete coincidence! This also could've been easily done in one R code chunk, but isn't it more fun to import a few libraries and use different languages to code?


This was a very simplistic example, but reticulate is a very powerful tool and can be used in much more creative ways than how I used it. After all, not everyone uses it solely because it is a requirement for a project they've been assigned. I digress.


###Farewell

Thanks to whoever eventually reads this. I hope this was mildly entertaining to read. If not, I threw in both a funny and a cute picture in the hopes that it will make you smile.


Best,

Jacks Pino
