###Hello to whoever is grading this!
Hi, Jacks here. This might not be as eloquent or as beautiful as one might like, but it'll get the job done.


In this blog post, I'm going to go over some basic Python concepts we learned in class. I will also use reticulate to show how you can move around information from R to Python and vice versa.


####Python Example

Let's talk about regular expression or regex. According to Google, the definition of regular expression is the following: a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. This is essentially control+F, just with more freedom in the characters you can look for.


For this example, I'm going to reference Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob Squarepants. More specifically, I will be referencing his laugh. Refer to this short clip if you have no idea what I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhM4VQFkw04


From a Reddit post, I found that the onomatopoeia of Mr. Krabs's laugh is "argh argh argha rghargh" - thus, that is the string we will be using for this example.


To find an instance of `a` followed by one other character, we run the following code:


```{python}
import re
mkl="argh argh argha rghargh"
re.findall(r"a.",mkl)
```


To find an instance of `a` followed by 2 alphanumeric characters, we run the following code:


```{python}
re.findall(r"a\w\w",mkl)

```


Finally, to find an instance of `argh`, followed by a space, we run the following code:


```{python}
re.findall(r"argh\s",mkl)
```

####Reticulate Example

Words here

```{R}
#code here
```

```{python}
#more code here
```

I will leave you with a funny picture and a cute picture:
