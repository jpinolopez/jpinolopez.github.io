###Hello to whoever is grading this!
Hi, Jacks here. This might not be as eloquent or as beautiful as one might like, but it'll get the job done.

In this blog post, I'm going to go over some basic Python concepts we learned in class. I will also use reticulate to show how you can move around information from R to Python and vice versa.

```{r}
#am i doing this right
(100 / 2) + 19
```

```{python}
#we're about to find out
269 % 100
```

I will leave you with a funny picture and a cute picture:
