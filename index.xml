      <description> Hello to whoever is grading this! Hi, Jacks here. This might not be as eloquent or as beautiful as one might like, but it&#39;ll get the job done.
In this blog post, I&#39;m going to go over some basic Python concepts we learned in class. I will also use reticulate to show how you can move around information from R to Python and vice versa.
