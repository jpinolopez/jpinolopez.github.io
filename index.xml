      <description>Hello to whoever is grading this! Hi, Jacks here. This might not be as eloquent or as beautiful as one might like, but it&#39;ll get the job done.
In this blog post, I&#39;m going to go over a basic but powerful concept in Python we learned in class. I will also use reticulate to demonstrate how you can move around information from R to Python and vice versa, as per the rubric.</description>

      <description>Hello again to whoever is grading this! I&#39;m making this blog post in the hopes that Dr. Woodward has mercy on me and either lets me turn in some assignments late or gives me an incomplete for the semester. I am really, truly hoping for a miracle. I don&#39;t want to fail this class. (Especially because I felt I was doing really well until we reached the 3/4 mark...)</description>

      <description>Jacks Pino - jap6527 - SDS 348 - 12/11/2020  Introduction I chose to use data I found on gapminder.org, which has a plethora of data of the world&#39;s countries. The variables I chose to look at in particular were the following: fertility rate, child mortality rate, food supply, the proportion of billionaires, the proportion of those who have access to basic sanitation, population density, and the rate of inflation.</description>

      <description>Jacks Pino - jap6527 - SDS 348 - 10/19/2020 Introduction For my exploratory data analysis, I chose to use the data I previously used for my SDS 328M final project last semester. For my final project last semester, I had manually combined different datasets to determine if there was any relationship between the rate of HIV in a given county, its urbanization status or setting (meaning if it was rural or urban), and the percentage of disconnected youth (meaning the percentage of people ages 16-19 that were not in school or employed).</description>

      <description>Jacks Pino, jap6527  Question 1 We will analyze some data from a famous case of alleged gender discrimination in admission to graduate programs at UC Berkeley in 1973. The three variables are Admit (Admitted, Rejected), Gender (Male, Female), and Dept (Departments A, B, C, D, E, F). First, create a dichotomous outcome variable \(y\) that is 1 if Admit==&amp;quot;Admitted&amp;quot; and 0 otherwise.
1.1 (2 pts) Predict \(y\) from Gender using a logistic regression.</description>
